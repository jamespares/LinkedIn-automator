LinkedIn Automation Script

Overview

This Python script automates the process of applying to saved jobs on LinkedIn that have the "Easy Apply" option. The script logs into your LinkedIn account, navigates to your saved jobs, and applies to those that allow for easy application. It also handles the uploading of your CV and cover letter and prompts you in the terminal if there are any additional questions during the application process.

The script is designed to mimic human behavior with random wait times between actions to minimize the risk of being flagged by LinkedIn for automated activity.
